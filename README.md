# Math game

## Overview
**Advanced Math** is a math game that allows the user to select between elementary and advanced game modes and solve randomly generated problems.

## Features
- Utilizes Custom Tkinter to create more modern windows and an easy-to-understand interface
- Allows the user to select between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in elementary game modes.
- Allows the user to select between quadratic, logarithmic, and pythagorean equations in advanced game modes.
- Randomly selects numbers and prints them on a screen so the user can answer.
- Takes in user input for the answer and a submit button that checks answers.
- Displays results.
- After submission, the submit button is temporarily disabled until refreshed to prevent cheating/spamming.
- Refresh button to generate new numbers
- Exception handling, the code will not accept anything other than numbers

## Why I Built It
I built this math game to test my knowledge of basic Python and explore new aspects of the language. Recently, I made a simle math game where I tested my newfound knowledge of the language and built my first non-terminal program. This time, I used CustomTkinter to make a more visually appealing application and added new game modes that were much harder to implement in code (quadratic formula, pythagorean, and logarithms). It was rewarding to see my progress and was a fun learning experience.

## Future Improvements
- Likely done. It is already an improvement of a previous game, although I may add new game modes/equations later on.
